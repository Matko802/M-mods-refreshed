This is modpack for modrinth, my first modpack so expect bugs and glitches.


About:

M Mods Refreshed is my very first modpack, put together to make Minecraft run better and feel smoother without getting in the way of vanilla gameplay. It's perfect for multiplayer since it's all client-side, meaning it won't get in the way of servers or other players. If you require better FPS, small UI enhancements, or just a smoother experience overall, this pack has got you covered.
-What's Inside?

-Improved Performance – FPS increases, lag reduction, and overall smoother gameplay through mods such as Sodium and Lithium.
-Quality of Life Features – Minor adjustments that make life easier, such as improved tooltips and enhanced inventory management.
-Enhanced UI & Visuals – Cleaner menus, improved lighting, and subtle visual enhancements for a more refined appearance.
-No Major Gameplay Changes – All of this is designed to enhance, not change, so it still feels like vanilla Minecraft—just better.
-Multiplayer Friendly – Works on any server since all mods are client-side.
